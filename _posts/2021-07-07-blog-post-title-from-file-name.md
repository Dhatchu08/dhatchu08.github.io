Cognitive Fitness: Pain Is Inevitable. How to Alleviate It and Use It to Your Advantage.

Written by Anil Rajput

This book is divided into ten topics and each chapter wings a different purpose. This book speaks about the progress in cognitive competence and resilience for success. It also conveys certain strategies and vital techniques to manage stress, anxiety, disorders, failures, and complexity.

We keep looking for medications and we are not aware that it all depends on our nervous system. It contains a few illustrations which give a clear vision of the ideology shared by the author and it also gives a better explanation of principles. This book not only knocks on the scientific door but also notches us motivational. It contributes a sensible and practical solution to most of the difficulties we encounter. This book is definitely worth a try. It gives fresh ideas which you can actually implement and practice in your real life. This is a balanced book on how to stay mentally fit in the rushing the world. The language is not simple, due to the new vocabulary, which for the same reason I wouldn't recommend this for beginners. The writing style is engaging and well written. I must appreciate the author for this wonderful book packed with high cognitive content, which needs a lot of research. The cover is quite attractive to me and the title is well inclined with the content of the book. It is a must-read for the readers who are looking to realize what should be the actual strategy in achieving in your life. I would recommend this book to people who look for change through personal growth and development.
