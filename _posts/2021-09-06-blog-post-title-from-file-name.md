<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3c/ec/bd/3cecbd5f0ba927df2df752f0a0094e42.jpg">

The story was set in future 2321 where AI robots replaced human in all fields. The story began with Father Ashok Daughter Ahalya duo conversation insisting the essence and importance of daily prayers. 

The book is deeply influenced by hindu epic Ramayan. The Author made slight alterations in characters name but their traits remained almost the same. For instance, Hanuman as "Hanmon" and Ram as "Saamarthya Ram". It took some time for me to sense what was happening when Ashok narrated the main plot.

 The minor details in the book were fascinating. It shows the author's deep knowledge about epics and places around the world. It was a sincere and creative attempt to recreate a modern Ramayan. I could always count on good writing, vivid descriptions that stayed true to the period the story was set in, and a great narrative voice. The only thing that striked me was the flow. At times, the plot seemed to be not gripping. 

All in All, this was a wonderful read, which stayed true to its promise, and delivered a creative content.
