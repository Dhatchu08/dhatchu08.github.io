<b>How I came to know about the IIDE Virtual Internship Programme(VIP) ? </b>

I noticed IIDE VIP through my college faculty. She received a mail from IIDE to circulate their VIP among her students. Interested students from our college registered for it. 


<b>How was the selection process?</b>

On September 4, 2022, I registered for it. The application process was vigorous and tiresome. They claimed in their mail that they would select 150 interns only. On September 6, I received an official selection mail from Ms.Shreya Ravaria stating the roles, responsibilities, and other details. It was a 5-week program with five days a week. My college time was 08:30 a.m. to 01:30 p.m.  It started at 04:00 p.m. every day. Though it was an unpaid internship, I thought the opportunity cost of getting an internship completion certificate and a good experience would be higher than my monetary loss. Little did I know that I would be fucked up.


<b>My Experience:</b>

The internship started at 04:00 p.m. on September 12 which was supposed to be a "fun orientation session". Their Primary emphasis was to make us turn our videos on. We had to copy the dance steps of our VIP manager. Some refused to dance, she threatened that they wouldn't get their certificate.
They gave several assignments with a sickening deadline. They made us write articles about their company's courses, generate leads for their Free masterclass sessions, and so on. All of these had a lot of rules to abide by. For instance, the write-up should be plagiarism-free, SEO optimized, font style, font size, word limit, etc. Their minimum word count was insanely bizarre that no one could make it. All of their targets were impractical and inconsiderate. When someone dared to question it, she would turn the table around and blame us that we were not working hard enough. Then, her immediate reaction was to blackmail us into not getting the certificate. It was going on as a loop for several days. This toxicity peaked to a point where I could not bare anymore. I realized that my mental health was more important than a preposterous internship certificate.
I finally decided to quit it.


<b>Conclusion:</b>

My overall experience was not pleasant and I would not recommend it if you can't work in a pressurized environment with no incentive. If you still decide to go for it, be ready to undergo their absurd "work culture".  You should neither expect professionalism nor respect for your work.
