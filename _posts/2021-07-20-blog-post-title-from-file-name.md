Blurb:-

Pinto is a middle level officer in the Internal Security Agency, or ISA who discovers, through a series of episodic experiences that the template for catching spies is not the gun toting flamboyance of James Bond. Nor, for that matter, is it the dull grey world of Smiley’s People. Much of it is patient pursuit and back end planning lit by the occasional flash of brilliance. Yet, even if there are no adrenaline spikes and meetings in the shadows of the gloaming; Pinto enjoys his job with the all the mental challenges and the perseverance it requires. Like in any other government department, Pinto too has to deal with failing room coolers, an aging car and the quirks of officialdom; but there is a professional core in the organization that, with good humour, sensitivity and patience, is able to carry the day. The book also has side stories that, though occasionally anecdotal, paint Pinto’s life in vibrant colours.

Review:-

When I read a fiction book, the whole plot rolls in my mind as if I'm watching a movie. Unfortunately, I could get those imageries in some parts of the book only. At times, I felt totally out of the plot and couldn't figure out what's going on. With the above impression, the plot flow wasn't smooth and the writing style is rough to read. I know, the author had put in so much efforts on selection of words. It's obvious by reading but the author had given less importance on plot flow which has a huge impact on readers.

I liked the Story line. The author's imagination was impressive and it's more like a real life story. The story line was backed up by accurate detailing and twists. I would give five star if I were to rate the story line. All the details mentioned in the book provides me a profound knowledge about ISA. The characters are firmly crafted and developed through different phases of the book.

Overall the book seems to be a thrilling and enigmatic read. This book is a great piece of thriller for young readers.
